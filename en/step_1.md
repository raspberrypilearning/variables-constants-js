### Variables 

A variable is a named area of computer memory that holds a value. 

The value can be changed by the program.

For example, `var age = 10;` 
+ `age` is the name of the variable. 
+ It is assigned the value `10`.

In the example, the variable is created using the keyword `var`.

The keyword `let` can also be used. Variables declared using the keyword `let` can be used globally (throughout the program, like `var`) or used within a specific block of code, with changes limited to within that block.

### Constants

A constant is a named data value. 

The value cannot be changed by the program.

Therefore, you cannot reassign the value of a constant once you have declared it.

For example:

    `const PI = 3.314159265359;`

`PI` cannot be assigned another value throughout the program.
